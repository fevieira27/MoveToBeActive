# MoveToBeActive Watch Faces for Garmin
![MoveToBeActive Banner](https://github.com/fevieira27/MoveToBeActive/blob/main/GitHub/banner%20v3.png?raw=true)

Garmin Watch Face that was inspired by the design of the Vivomove series, adding extra features that will be very useful for my daily type of usage (more health related than activity tracking) and focusing on maximizing battery life.

## Feature listing:
* Analog hands for Hour and Minutes, but not for Seconds to mimic Vivomove HR (and save battery). Design menu has a toggle for thinner, standard or thicker hands (around 20-30% difference between each);
* **Current Date** with day of the week and Month;
* **Garmin Logo** that can be hidden on the watch face's config menu;
* **Battery indicator** with symbol changing colors depending on battery left: Red (less than or equal to 20%), Yellow (between 21 and 40%) and Green (greater than 40%). The text can be displayed as remaining % or estimated number of days until running out;
* **Bluetooth** indicator: Blue (connected to the phone) or grey (not connected);
* **Alarm** indicator: Accent color (at least one alarm active) or grey (no alarms);
* **Do not Disturb** indicator (only shown when mode is activate, also activated during sleep hours);
* **Location name** of the source of weather data (if available), that can be hidden on the watch face's config menu;
* **Current weather** condition icon;
* **Temperature** indicator (if available) in Celsius or Fahrenheit (also dependent on watch's selected units display). The temperature number will become blue when that is the minimum temperature for the day, as well as orange when that is the maximum;
* **Colored Tickmarks** following selected accent color. Can be turned on and off (showing gray tickmarks);
* **Colored AOD Mode**: gives the user the option of seeing the AOD mode hands and tickmarks in grayscale or full color (thanks [filmo003](https://github.com/filmo003) for the code);

## Available Data Fields:
* **Notifications** count: Accent color if at least one notification is available or grey if no unread notifications;
* **Heart Rate** data, showing last available value (not updated every second when not doing an activity, to save battery) and a symbol that is presented with colors from 7 different rate zones, set up by the user on the watch main settings (Settings - User Profile - Heart Rate - Zones - Based On). Color palette for each zone: Resting / Light Load = grey, Moderate Effort = blue, Weight Control = green, Aerobic = yellow, Anaerobic = orange, High effort = light red and Speed = bright red;
* **Calories** burned;
* **Steps**: Shows the number of steps on the current day and icon color will also change to the selected Accent when steps goal has been met;
* **Blood oxygen** percentage: will display the current pulse ox if the sensor is active all the time. However, if sensor is activated only while sleeping or on ad-hoc measurements, data point will show last available value. Color palette doesn't follow accent color and is based on 5 zones: Healthy = green, Normal = blue, Low = yellow, Brain Dysfunction = orange, Cyanosis = red;
* **Floors climbed** count: Icon will be displayed in grey until floors climbed goal has been met, changing to the Accent color of choice;
* **Precipitation** percentage: The current chance of rain/snow precipitation (0-100%), with blue tones color palette based on 4 zones: Low = light blue, Moderate = blue, High = dark blue, Very High = purple;
* **Humidity** percentage: The current relative humidity (0-100%), with color palette based on 3 levels: Healthy = green, Fair = yellow, Poor = red;
* **Atmospheric Pressure**: The current barometer read in hPa/millibars or calibrated mean at sea-level, with color palette based on 3 levels: High-pressure = blue, Normal = Gray, Low-pressure = orange;
* **Solar intensity** percentage: Describes the solar sensor's charge efficiency, only available on Solar Charged watches. It will change colors based on 5 different UV intensity zones: Low = green, Moderate = yellow, High = orange, Very High = red, Extreme = violet;
* **Intensity Minutes** per week: The current number of intensity minutes (moderate + 2x vigorous) during the current week. Symbol will turn from grey to the accent color as soon as the weekly intensity minutes goal is reached;
* **Seconds**: Available as a data field, will display seconds count of the current time;
* **VO2 Max** from Running or Cycling (available and 2 separate data fields);
* **Body Battery**;
* **Stress** Level;
* **Respiration** Rate;
* **Recovery Time** in hours;
* **Min/Max Temperature** forecasted for the day (*only available on the left top and middle data points*);
* **Wind speed**: Current wind speed in km/h or mph (depending on watch's pace unit settings), or m/s if selected on the watch face's settings (*only available on the left top and middle data points*);
* **Elevation** (altitude above mean sea level in meters): Derived from the most accurate source (Barometer or GPS) in order of descending accuracy. If no GPS is present, then barometer readings will be used (*only available on the left top and middle data points*);
* **Distance** walked/ran on the day (km or miles, dependent on watch's selected unit on general config): Icon will be displayed in grey until steps goal has been met, changing to the Accent color of choice (*only available on the left top and middle data points*);
* **Battery Consumption** per day since last charge, displayed in average%/day. For this to work, you need to be using the MoveToBeActive watch face when charging your watch, or else the displayed consumption percentage might be incorrect (with impossible figures) or not shown.
* **Weather Forecast** that shows either next 2 or 3 hours of weather condition, depending on the location selected by the user. The top left and middle left locations allow 3h, while all the others can only fit 2 hours.

**5.2.2** (11/December/24)
- [X] Fixed bug on the new forecast data field that happens whenever the weather station is not sending any weather data
- [X] Addressing another error related to the atmospheric pressure not being available
- [X] Updated to Garmin SDK 7.4.2

**5.2.2** (11/December/24)
- [X] Fixed bug on the new forecast data field that happens whenever the weather station is not sending any weather data
- [X] Addressing another error related to the atmospheric pressure not being available
- [X] Updated to Garmin SDK 7.4.2

**5.3.0** (28/December/24)
- [X] For watches that enough have space available, the watch face won't change the altitute to km anymore. But for some low resolution watches (especially if using big font size for data fields) this update unfortunately won't be possible, so they will still keep the previous behaviour of showing in km after 999m.
- [X] Improved positioning of notifications icon across all watches and positions on the watch face
- [X] Fixed bug with the weather forecast data field, which gives an IQ screen if bluetooth connection is lost or forecast data is not being provided by the weather station for at least 2 hours.
- [X] Now giving the user an option to reduce the Date font (if watch has a smaller font size available)
- [X] Added the seconds hand also to MIP screens, but not all the time (only when using gestures, like the digital seconds that is currently available). I'm not willing to allow it to be on all the time since it occupies a huge portion of the screen and becomes a huge battery drain. Most people don't actually understand how an MIP screen works and will blame my watch face for the high battery consumption.
- [X] SDK 7.4.2 was discontinued by Garmin and is not available anymore, which can only mean that it had critical bugs. Due to this, I'm rushing this updated to now compile this WF with SDK 7.4.3, which I hope will fix issues with several watches (mostly on VivoActive 5 since they lack a critical sensor for several data fields - Barometer, but also on other watches which would still have issues, only less frequent).

**5.3.4** (07/January/25)
- [X] Adding support for new Instinct 3 AMOLED watches (45 and 50mm).

**5.3.5** (29/January/25)
- [X] Adding support for new Approach S44 and S50 watches.
- [X] Added precicipation chance to the weather condition description, whenever the current condition is rain, snow or wintry mix.
- [X] The hour hand when using light theme is now darker to make it easier to read. The previous light gray color was too similar to the white background on MIP screens. The cannon pinion is now also displayed in black.
- [X] On AMOLED watches, the cannon pinion is now full black when in always on display to avoid pixel burn-in.
- [X] Small tweak to reduce battery consumption and storage usage of seconds hand (mostly noticeable for MIP, but also for applicable to AMOLED).
- [X] Fixed an issue with the Matterhorn accent color (light theme only) that was being incorrectly shown as light gray.

**5.3.6** (09/March/25)
- [X] Adding support for new Tactix 8 AMOLED and Solar watches.
- [X] Added cloud cover and UV level to the weather condition description, whenever the current condition is respectively cloudy or sunny.
- [X] Updated to Garmin SDK 8.1.0 (System 8)
- [X] Fixed the battery text when using estimation in days on light theme, which was being displayed in white when battery between 20 and 40, making it hard to read. The text is now black.

5.3.7 update - 07/Apr/25
- [X] Adding support for newly released Vivoactive 6 watch;
- [X] Updated to Garmin SDK 8.1.1 (System 8);

5.3.8 update - 08/Apr/25
- [X] Improved visibility of battery %/estimate text when using light theme.

5.3.9 update - 14/Jun/25
- [X] Adding support for newly released ForeRunner 570 (42 and 47mm) and 970 watches;

**5.4.0** (Estimated Q3 2025)
- [ ] On AMOLED watches, the background color is now light gray instead of white. Still not great for battery life, but a white background on that type of screen can be hard to read (too bright), even on lowest brightness levels.
- [ ] Add new data field to show UV level (from Weather Condition)

**5.5.0** (Estimated Q4 2025)
