# MoveToBeActive Garmin Watch Face
![alt text](https://github.com/fevieira27/MoveToBeActive/blob/main/GitHub/Logo2-MoveToBeActive.png?raw=true)

Garmin Watch Face that was initially meant for the VivoActive 4 series, as I want to replace my current Vivomove HR soon. Even though I'm now going to move (no pun intended) to a more smartwatch kind of device instead of a hybrid, I do prefer the regular/classic look of an analog watch. So that's when I decided to start developing a watch face inspired by the design of the Vivomove series, but adding extra features that will be very useful for my daily type of usage (more health related than activity tracking).

I have tested/adapted this watch face to work with a few other rounded devices, including the new flagship Enduro (see picture below). I will be testing other watches soon an adding support on new releases.

## Feature listing:
* Analog hands for Hour and Minutes, but not for Seconds to mimic Vivomove HR (and save battery);
* Garmin Logo;
* Current Date;
* Battery percentage with symbol changing colors depending on battery left: Red (<=15%), Yellow (between 16 and 30%) and Green (>30%);
* Heart Rate data, showing current value and a symbol that is presented with colors from 5 different rate zones: Grey (<90 bpm), Blue (between 90 and 113 bpm), Green (between 114 and 137 bpm), Yellow (between 138 and 161 bpm) and Red (>=162 bpm);
* Notifications count;
* Floors climbed count;
* Distance traveled on the day (km or miles, dependent on watch's general config);
* Bluetooth indicator: Blue (connected to phone) or Grey (not connected);
* Do not Disturb indicator (only shown if active).
