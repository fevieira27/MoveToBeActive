# MoveToBeActive Garmin Watch Face
Work in progress (not yet published) Garmin Watchface that was initially meant for the VivoActive 4 series, as I am going to replace my old Vivomove HR soon. However, even though I'm now going to move (no pun intended) to a more smartwatch kind of devide, I do prefer the regular/classic look of an analog watch. So I developed this watch face to mimic the design of the Vivomove Hybrid series, but adding extra features that would be useful to me for daily usage.

I have tested/adapted this watch face to work with a few other rounded devices, including the new flagship Enduro.

## Feature listing:
* Analog hands with seconds removed to mimic Vivomove HR (and save battery);
* Garmin Logo;
* Current Date;
* Battery percentage with 3 colors: Red (<=10%), Yellow (between 11 and 20%) and Green (>20%);
* Heart Rate with 5 zones: Grey (<90 bpm), Blue (between 90 and 113 bpm), Green (between 114 and 137 bpm), Yellow (between 138 and 161 bpm) and Red (>=162 bpm);
* Notifications count;
* Distance traveled on the day;
* Bluetooth indicator: Blue (connected to phone) or Grey (not connected);
* Do not Disturb indicator (if applicable);
* Floors climbed count.
